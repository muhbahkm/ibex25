# IBEX Vision

## Overview

IBEX (آيبكس) is a cloud-first Sales Engine designed for retail businesses, starting with supermarkets and small stores.

## Core Purpose

IBEX focuses on streamlining the sales process for retail operations. It provides a modern, cloud-based solution for managing sales transactions, customers, products, and basic inventory.

## What IBEX Is

- **Sales Engine**: A focused system for creating and managing sales invoices
- **Customer Management**: Support for both registered customers and guest transactions
- **Product Catalog**: Product management with pricing and stock tracking
- **Credit Management**: Simple credit tracking through unpaid invoices
- **Inventory Basics**: Automatic stock deduction when invoices are created
- **Cloud-First**: Designed to run in the cloud with local development support

## What IBEX Is NOT

IBEX is **NOT** a full accounting system. It deliberately excludes:

- Double-entry accounting
- Ledger and chart of accounts
- Tax and VAT calculations
- Complex inventory management (warehouses, transfers, etc.)
- Offline mode
- Payment gateway integrations (in MVP)

## Target Users

- Supermarkets
- Small retail stores
- Businesses that need simple sales tracking without full accounting complexity

## Design Philosophy

- **Simplicity First**: Focus on core sales operations
- **Cloud-Native**: Built for cloud deployment from day one
- **Backend-First**: All business logic lives in the backend
- **Append-Only**: Invoices are immutable once created
- **Minimal Complexity**: Avoid over-engineering

## Future Vision

IBEX will evolve into a comprehensive sales management platform while maintaining its focus on simplicity and ease of use. The system is designed to grow with businesses' needs without becoming overly complex.
